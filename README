These are some statistics utilities and functions written in a few different 
languages (Python and Julia for now...) which I am writing as an educational
exercise, both for statistics, and Julia (and others). Do not use these unless
you know what you are doing. Thay are not garanteed to be correct and/or 
harmless. Fair warning.
